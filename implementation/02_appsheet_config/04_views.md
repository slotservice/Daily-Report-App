# Views

AppSheet view layout for each role. Each view is created in **UX → Views**.

The app uses a **role-pivoted home view** — when the user signs in, AppSheet routes them to the right deck via the `App start expression`. Because `Users.Role` is an EnumList (a single user can hold multiple roles), we use `IFS()` with `IN()` checks rather than `SWITCH()` so the first matching role wins. The order is intentional: a user who is both Director and SiteSuperintendent (e.g. Evan) lands on the Director Dashboard, since reviewing across projects is the senior role.

```
IFS(
  IN("Director",           LOOKUP(USEREMAIL(), "Users", "Email", "Role")), LINKTOVIEW("Director Dashboard"),
  IN("ProjectManager",     LOOKUP(USEREMAIL(), "Users", "Email", "Role")), LINKTOVIEW("Manager Inbox"),
  IN("Coordinator",        LOOKUP(USEREMAIL(), "Users", "Email", "Role")), LINKTOVIEW("Manager Inbox"),
  IN("SiteSuperintendent", LOOKUP(USEREMAIL(), "Users", "Email", "Role")), LINKTOVIEW("Super Home"),
  IN("Admin",              LOOKUP(USEREMAIL(), "Users", "Email", "Role")), LINKTOVIEW("Admin Console"),
  TRUE,                                                                     LINKTOVIEW("Manager Inbox")
)
```

  3. *Notable Events:* NotableEvents
- **All other content** (tasks, trades, photos, time, equipment, rentals, visitors, deliveries) is captured **after save** via inline child-table actions on the detail view. This keeps the form minimal so a foreman can hit save in under 30 seconds, then add the rich content as the day unfolds.
- **Form Saved Behavior:** `Go to view` → `Today's Report` (the Detail view of the just-saved row).

### Form: `Tasks_Form`
- Standard Add/Edit form, all columns visible.

### Form: `Photos_Form`

### Forms for `Equipment`, `Rentals`, `Visitors`, `Deliveries`, `ReportTrades`, `TimeEntries`
- Standard inline-add forms reached via the `+` button on each section of `Today's Report`. ReportID hidden and prefilled from the parent.
